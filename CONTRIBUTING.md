# 🤝 CONTRIBUTING to AITL Project

Thank you for considering contributing to the **AITL (All-in-Theory Logic)** Project!

This guide outlines how you can contribute to this open-source initiative, which integrates theory, control, and real-world robotics through the Samizo Architecture.

---

## 🧭 Who Can Contribute?

Anyone interested in:

- AI system architecture  
- Formal control models (FSM, H∞, etc.)  
- Robotics, embedded systems, or simulation  
- Education and technical documentation  
- Societal applications (space, disaster, elder care)

## 🛠 Areas to Contribute

| Type                      | Examples                                               |
|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| 💻 Code Contributions     | FSM modules, LLM adapters, control interfaces, drivers |
| 📚 Documentation         | Tutorials, PoC guides, architecture diagrams           |
| 🤖 Robotics Integration   | Control implementations on real robots or simulators   |
| 📘 Educational Content    | Teaching materials based on AITL                       |
| 🌐 Internationalization   | Translating `README.md`, guides into other languages   |
| 🧪 Application Use Cases  | Proposals for new domains (e.g., agriculture, healthcare) |

## 🧱 Code Style and Language

- Python ≥3.9 recommended  
- Use `snake_case` for variables/functions  
- Modular structure per component (FSM / LLM / H∞)  
- Add comments in English or Japanese where relevant

✅ Format YAML for FSM definitions using consistent indent  
✅ LLM interface logic should be decoupled and testable  
✅ Robust control logic (H∞) may use `scipy`, `control`, or `cvxpy`
