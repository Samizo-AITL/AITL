---

## üß† 1. Introduction

This proposal introduces **AITL-GPT**, a unified AI architecture co-developed with ChatGPT.  
Based on the concept of **All-in-Theory Logic (AITL)**, the model integrates three major AI domains:  
control AI, physical AI, and self-repairing AI.

---

## üéØ 2. Objective

To provide a foundational model that can:

- Bridge **logical design and physical implementation**
- Enhance **AI explainability, resilience, and modularity**
- Contribute to **safe and open AI development**

---

## üîß 3. AITL-GPT Framework Overview

| Domain | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Control AI | Handles control logic, decision trees, and signal flows |
| Physical AI | Incorporates mathematical/physical laws and simulations |
| Self-repair AI | Diagnoses inference failure and regenerates reasoning paths |

The AITL-GPT model can be applied to **robotics**, **education**, and **policy-level safety design**.

---

## ü§ñ 4. Applied Use Case: AITL for Robotics / GPT v1.0-R

A concrete implementation using:

- 3nm AI SoC + 0.18¬µm sensor-control AMS chip
- FeRAM + DRAM memory architecture
- PoC-level robotic AI modules (Sky-HyEV Robotics Models)

---

## üìö 5. Educational and Industrial Deployment

- Provided as open-source curriculum via `SystemDK / PoCDK`
- Enables hands-on learning of AI circuits, control flow, and inference debugging
- Highly suitable for both university education and prototyping

---

## üß© 6. Contribution to OpenAI and Beyond

AITL-GPT offers:

- A testbed for **physical-informed AI (PIAI)** architecture
- A blueprint for **modular AI safety engineering**
- A real-world framework co-developed with ChatGPT
