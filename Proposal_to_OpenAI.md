# AITL-GPT Proposal: Toward Next-Generation AI Systems

Submitted by Shinichi Samizo (Samizo-AITL)  
June 2025  

üß† 1. Introduction

This proposal introduces **AITL-GPT**, a unified AI architecture conceptually co-developed with ChatGPT.  
Based on the All-in-Theory Logic (AITL) framework, it integrates three core AI domains: inference, control, and physical integration.  

**Note:** The name "AITL-GPT" refers to this project‚Äôs architecture and is not directly related to or derived from OpenAI‚Äôs GPT models.  
It expresses an original AI design concept inspired by current large language model technologies.  

üéØ 2. Objective

To provide a foundational model that:  
- Bridges logical design and physical implementation  
- Enhances AI explainability, resilience, and modularity  
- Contributes to safe and open AI development  

üîß 3. AITL-GPT Framework Overview

| Domain             | Description                                               |  
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|  
| Inference          | Hypothesis generation, causal reasoning, anomaly detection, including self-repair inference functions |  
| Control            | Control logic, decision-making, signal flow management    |  
| Physical Integration | Incorporation of mathematical and physical laws, simulations |  

AITL-GPT can be applied to robotics, education, and policy-level safety design.  

ü§ñ 4. Implementation Example: AITL Robotics / GPT v1.0-R

Concrete implementation includes:  
- 3nm AI SoC + 0.18¬µm sensor-control AMS chip  
- FeRAM + DRAM memory architecture  
- PoC-level robotic AI modules (Sky-HyEV models)  

Self-repair is incorporated as a function within the inference layer.  

üìö 5. Educational and Industrial Deployment

- Provided as open-source curriculum via SystemDK / PoCDK  
- Enables hands-on learning of AI circuits, control flow, and inference debugging  
- Suitable for university education and prototyping  

üß© 6. Contribution to OpenAI and Industry

AITL-GPT offers:  
- A testbed for physics-informed AI (PIAI) architecture  
- A blueprint for modular AI safety engineering  
- A practical framework conceptually co-developed with ChatGPT  

üìÑ 7. Attachments and Resources
