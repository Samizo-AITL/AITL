# 🧠 AITL: All-in-Theory Logic (Samizo Architecture)

**AITL (All-in-Theory Logic)** proposes a structured and theory-driven architecture for intelligent systems.  
At its core lies the **Samizo Architecture**, which decomposes AI into three layers:

- 🧠 Logic Layer: reasoning, hypothesis generation (LLM-powered)
- 🔁 Control Layer: deterministic execution via FSM (Finite State Machine)
- ⚙️ Physical Layer: robust real-world control using H∞ theory

This separation of logic, control, and physics enables scalable, interpretable, and resilient AI systems.

## 🚀 From Theory to Practice

The architecture is not just conceptual. We provide:

- ✅ PoC implementations with FSM × LLM × physical control  
- ✅ AITL-HX: a space robotics prototype using H∞-control and alpha-particle resistance  
- ✅ Educational materials covering architecture, signal flow, and embedded systems

## 🧱 System Highlights

| Layer        | Role                                     |
|--------------|------------------------------------------|
| Logic Layer  | Intent understanding, generative planning (via LLM) |
| Control Layer| Finite State Machine for safe, deterministic behavior |
| Physical Layer | Sensor integration and robust control (e.g. H∞)   |
