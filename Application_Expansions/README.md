# 🚀 AITL Application Expansions

This section introduces real-world **application scenarios** and concept projects built upon the AITL architecture.  
Each project combines theory-driven logic, control, and robust physical implementation to address high-impact domains.

---

## 🧭 Purpose of This Section

- Connect theory (Samizo Architecture) to practical systems  
- Demonstrate modularity and adaptability of FSM × LLM × H∞ structure  
- Provide blueprints for prototyping, deployment, and collaboration
