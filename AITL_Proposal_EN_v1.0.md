# üá∫üá∏ AITL Initiative: Proposal for a National Integrated AI Design

**For Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) and NEDO**  
Supervisor: Shinichi Samizo  
Date: June 23, 2025

---

## üß≠ Introduction

This initiative is based on the uniquely Japanese AI and semiconductor design philosophy called "AITL (All-in-Theory Logic),"  
and proposes a next-generation integrated AI, control, and energy technology framework.

- Japan‚Äôs original AI-semiconductor integrated design theory "AITL"
- Models for self-powering and self-repairing AI social implementations
- Development of educational platforms and human resource training
- Guidelines for policy collaboration and regional demonstration

---

## üß© Background and Challenges

Current technology and policy landscapes face the following challenges:

- Fragmented and locally optimized AI and semiconductor development
- Insufficient focus on energy autonomy and sustainability
- Gap between educational curricula and practical implementation
- Weak collaboration between policymakers and technical/educational fields

## üîß Overview of the AITL Initiative

This initiative consists of four main pillars:

| Component                  | Description                                   |
|----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| **AITL Theory**             | Structural AI design philosophy integrating logic, control, and physics |
| **AITL-Based AI Design Support** | Theory-driven control design and autonomous decision support framework |
| **Eco Power Platform**       | Self-powering AI platforms for urban, agricultural, and disaster prevention use cases |
| **AITL Implementation and PoCs** | Integrated PoC deployment with AITL-R (robotics) and SkyEdge (drones) |

## üî¨ Key Technology Elements (Examples)

- AI SoC designs (65nm to 3nm, GAA-compatible)
- AMS circuits (LDMOS, analog sensor interfaces)
- Multilayer PZT, organic thin-film solar cells, lithium-ion battery control
- MPPT control and low-power optimization techniques
