# 🧠 AITL - All-in-Theory Logic

**AITL (All-in-Theory Logic)** is a theoretical AI framework designed to organize and explain the structure of intelligent systems.  
It consists of a four-layer model—Inference, Control, Physical Integration, and Self-Repair—aimed at educational use and conceptual understanding.

Although implementation is currently limited, this project is openly shared to support learning, discussion, and future development.

## ✍️ About This Project

This repository began as an attempt to reconsider AI structure from the perspective of **semiconductor device engineering**.  
It summarizes key components such as system logic, physical integration, and self-repair, mainly for **educational and theoretical purposes**.

> 🔎 This project is not intended as a finished software product.  
> Its focus is on sharing a theoretical model, learning materials, and open proposals.

## 🧱 Overview of the 4-Layer Model

| Layer               | Role & Purpose                                  |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Inference Logic     | Hypothesis generation, causal reasoning, decision support |
| Control Logic       | PID control, model predictive control, reinforcement learning |
| Physical Integration| Sensor fusion, signal alignment, real-world interaction |
| Self-Repair Logic   | Anomaly detection, system reconfiguration, adaptive learning |
