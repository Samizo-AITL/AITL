# üß† AITL - All-in-Theory Logic (English Overview)

## Overview

AITL (All-in-Theory Logic) is a theoretical framework that structurally organizes intelligent systems using a layered architecture.  
Based on three foundational layers‚Äî**Logic**, **Control**, and **Physical**‚ÄîAITL aims to provide:

- Structural understanding of AI  
- Theory-driven design methodology  
- Educational and research applications  

Unlike data-centric black-box AI, AITL emphasizes interpretable, deterministic, and modular AI construction.  
It extends beyond theoretical models to include Proof-of-Concept (PoC) implementation guides and applications such as drones and robots.  
AITL is a comprehensive system model pursuing structure, physical consistency, and self-repairing intelligence.

## üßæ About This Project

This repository re-examines AI system design from the perspective of semiconductor device engineering.  
We aim to establish a theory-driven, physically consistent, and self-repairable AI structure.  
Rather than completing implementations or training models, AITL focuses on theoretical insight and educational value.

üîé **Note**: The project is not intended to deliver production-ready code.  
Its main objective is theory exploration, educational modeling, and open collaboration.

## ü§ù Contribution Opportunities

We welcome collaboration and concept sharing through:

- Technical contributions in implementation, control engineering, and robotics  
- Joint research based on the AITL framework  
- Use in academic teaching or technical education (MIT License)  

üîß Full implementation and hardware testing environments are under development.  
More details will be published in `CONTRIBUTING.md`.
