# üß† AITL - All-in-Theory Logic

## Overview

AITL (All-in-Theory Logic) is an AI architecture concept that structurally and theoretically models intelligent systems.  
This project is based on a **three-layer hierarchy** that integrates inference, control, and physical dynamics, aiming to:

- Support a deeper understanding of AI system structures  
- Provide design guidelines grounded in formal theory  
- Promote application in education and research  

AITL is not merely a theoretical proposal. It also envisions **practical validation at the PoC (Proof of Concept)** level, including real-world applications such as drones and robots.  
The framework emphasizes **structured design, physical consistency, and self-repair capabilities** as key principles in building meaningful AI.
