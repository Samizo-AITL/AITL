# üß† AITL - All-in-Theory Logic

## Overview

AITL (All-in-Theory Logic) is an AI architecture concept designed to structurally and theoretically model intelligent systems.  
This project is based on a hierarchical model integrating inference, control, and physical dynamics, with the following goals:

- To support a deeper understanding of AI system structures  
- To provide design guidelines based on formal theory  
- To assist in education and research use cases  

AITL is not just a theoretical proposal. It also envisions practical implementation at the PoC (Proof of Concept) level, including applications such as drones and robots.  
It emphasizes meaningful AI construction through structured design, physical consistency, and self-repair concepts.
