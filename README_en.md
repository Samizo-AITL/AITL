# 🧠 AITL - All-in-Theory Logic

**AITL (All-in-Theory Logic)** is a theoretical framework designed to help structure and understand intelligent systems.  
It introduces a four-layer model—Inference, Control, Physical Integration, and Self-Repair—to support education, research, and future applications.

While current implementation is limited, this repository shares the concept openly to encourage learning and collaboration.

## ✍️ About This Project

This project originated from the perspective of **semiconductor device engineering**, rethinking AI as a system with logical and physical layers.

> 🔎 This is not a completed software package.  
> The goal is to share a **structured conceptual model** and provide materials for **education and theoretical development**.

## 🧱 Overview of the Four-Layer Model

| Layer              | Main Role                                      |
|--------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Inference Logic    | Hypothesis generation, causal reasoning, decisions |
| Control Logic      | PID control, model predictive control, reinforcement learning |
| Physical Integration | Sensor fusion, signal alignment, interaction with physical environment |
| Self-Repair Logic  | Fault detection, reconfiguration, adaptive control |

👉 See [docs/AITL_Model_v1.0.md](docs/AITL_Model_v1.0.md) for detailed explanation.
