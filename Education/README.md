# 🎓 AITL Education – Learn Structured AI Architecture

Welcome to the **Educational section** of the AITL Project.  
Here you'll find structured learning resources to understand and apply the **Samizo Architecture**, which defines AI systems in three layers:

- Logic (LLM reasoning)
- Control (FSM-based decision logic)
- Physical (robust control and actuation)

---

## 📘 Learning Goals

This section is designed to support:

- 🎓 **Students** learning AI and robotics fundamentals  
- 👨‍💻 **Engineers** looking to implement interpretable AI control  
- 🧑‍🏫 **Educators** building curricula for control systems or AI reasoning  
- 🛰 **Researchers** testing robust architectures in complex domains
