# 🎓 AITL Education – Structured Learning for AI Architecture

Welcome to the **Education section** of the AITL Project.  
Here we provide comprehensive materials to **learn, test, and teach** structured AI systems based on the Samizo 3-layer model: Logic, Control, and Physical layers.

---

## 🧭 Educational Objectives

This section is designed to support:

- 🎓 **Students** learning foundational AI and control logic  
- 👩‍🏫 **Educators** preparing structured, theory-backed curricula  
- 🧑‍🔬 **Researchers** testing robust AI system integration  
- 👨‍💻 **Engineers** implementing LLM + FSM + Physical control

## 📘 Chapter 1: Fundamental of AITL Architecture

Focuses on the **core theory** (Samizo 3-layer architecture) and a working PoC called **AITL-HX**, which integrates:

- 🧠 LLM-based reasoning  
- 🔁 FSM state machine control  
- ⚙️ H∞ robust physical control
