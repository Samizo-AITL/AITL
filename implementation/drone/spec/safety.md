# Safety Specification - AITL Drone (Professional & SkyEdge Models)

## 1. Overview

This document outlines the safety features and fail-safe mechanisms implemented in AITL drones to ensure mission reliability and operator safety under various failure modes.

## 2. Failure Detection

- Continuous monitoring of sensor health (IMU, GPS, LiDAR, cameras)
- Actuator performance diagnostics (motor current, response latency)
- Communication link quality and latency tracking
- Power system status and battery health

## 3. Fail-Safe Strategies

- Automatic switch to manual control upon anomaly detection
- Return-to-Home (RTH) triggered on communication loss or low battery
- Emergency landing protocols for critical failures
- Redundant sensor fusion to mitigate single-point failures

## 4. Self-Repair Mechanisms

- Dynamic reconfiguration of flight control loops using eFPGA (for robotics)
- Software watchdog timers to reset hung processes
- Fault isolation and selective subsystem shutdown to preserve core functions
- Real-time alerts sent to ground control stations

## 5. Testing & Validation

- Simulated fault injection during HIL testing
- Field tests under sensor failure and communication degradation scenarios
- Safety compliance with relevant aviation regulations (e.g., FAA, EASA)
