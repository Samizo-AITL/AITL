# Diagnostics Specification - AITL Drone (Professional & SkyEdge Models)

## 1. Overview

This document specifies the diagnostics framework for AITL drones, encompassing real-time monitoring, logging, anomaly detection, and telemetry reporting to ensure operational reliability and support self-repair mechanisms.

## 2. Monitoring Components

- Sensor status monitoring (IMU, GPS, LiDAR, cameras)
- Actuator health checks (motor currents, response timing)
- Power system metrics (voltage, current, temperature)
- Communication link quality and latency

## 3. Logging System

- Event-driven logging with timestamping
- Circular buffers for onboard storage with overflow management
- Secure log transmission to ground control station

## 4. Anomaly Detection

- Threshold-based alerts for out-of-range sensor data
- Statistical anomaly detection using Kalman filters and Bayesian methods
- Fault classification and severity ranking

## 5. Telemetry and Reporting

- Periodic telemetry updates over Wi-Fi/LTE links
- Real-time alerts for critical failures
- Diagnostic data format compliant with SystemDK ingestion

## 6. Testing and Validation

- Simulation-based testing of fault injection scenarios
- Hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) validation
- Ground station software for log analysis and visualization
