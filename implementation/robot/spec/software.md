# Software Specification - AITL Robot (AITL-R Model)

## 1. Overview

This document details the software architecture and modules for the AITL-R robot model, emphasizing real-time control, sensor fusion, and self-repair mechanisms.

## 2. Operating System

- Embedded RTOS with real-time scheduling
- Support for Cortex-M7 architecture
- Containerization support planned for modular AI components

## 3. Middleware

- AITL middleware stack for inference and control abstraction
- Real-time communication via RTOS message queues and interrupts
- Integration with SystemDK-compatible interfaces

## 4. AI and Inference Modules

- CNN-based sensor data classification and anomaly detection
- MIMO sensor fusion algorithms for multi-channel data processing
- Self-repair control modules leveraging eFPGA reconfiguration

## 5. Control Algorithms

- PID and MPC controllers for actuator management
- Dynamic control loop reconfiguration based on fault detection
- Safety interlocks and manual override support

## 6. Diagnostics and Logging

- Real-time health monitoring with event-driven logging
- Fault detection and alert systems integrated with SystemDK telemetry
- Circular buffers and overflow management for logs

## 7. Development and Deployment

- CI/CD pipelines for embedded firmware
- Hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) testing frameworks
- OTA update support with secure boot
