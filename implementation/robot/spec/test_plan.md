# Test Plan and Evaluation Specification - AITL Robot (AITL-R Model)

## 1. Purpose

This document defines the test plan and evaluation criteria for the AITL-R robot model to ensure functionality, reliability, and performance according to design specifications.

## 2. Test Scope

- Functional Testing: Verification of software modules, sensor inputs, and actuator outputs  
- Performance Testing: Latency, throughput, and control accuracy  
- Fault Injection Testing: Evaluate fault detection and self-repair capabilities  
- Integration Testing: Confirm hardware-software coordination and SystemDK interface  
- Environmental Testing: Temperature, humidity, EMI, and mechanical stress

## 3. Test Environment

- Hardware test bench with real sensors and actuators  
- Hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) simulators  
- SystemDK telemetry and logging framework  
- Automated test scripts where applicable

## 4. Test Items and Criteria

| Test Item             | Description                            | Pass Criteria                     |
|-----------------------|------------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| Sensor Data Accuracy   | Correct sensor data acquisition    | Within Â±0.5% tolerance           |
| Control Response Time  | Time from sensor input to actuator command | < 50 ms                        |
| Fault Detection       | Detect injected faults             | 100% detection rate              |
| Self-repair Execution  | Successful reconfiguration post fault | Restore control within 300 ms   |
| Communication Integrity| Data exchange with SystemDK         | No packet loss > 0.1%            |
| Power Management      | Battery and power system behavior   | Stable voltage and current       |

## 5. Reporting
