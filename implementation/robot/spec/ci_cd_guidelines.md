# CI/CD Guidelines for AITL Robot Implementation

## 1. Overview

This document provides guidelines for continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) tailored for the AITL-R robot firmware and software development.

## 2. Tools and Platforms

- GitHub Actions for workflow automation  
- Static code analysis tools (e.g., flake8, clang-tidy)  
- Unit and integration testing frameworks  
- OTA update systems and secure bootloaders

## 3. Workflow

- Code pushed to `develop` branch triggers CI build and tests  
- Pull requests require successful CI runs and peer review before merge to `main`  
- Deployment to test hardware environments after passing integration tests

## 4. Testing Strategy

- Automated unit tests for all new code  
- Integration tests for hardware interaction and SystemDK connectivity  
- Manual validation for critical system updates

## 5. Branching and Release

- Feature branches off `develop`  
- `main` branch always reflects stable releases  
- Tagging and release notes maintained per semantic versioning

## 6. Monitoring and Feedback

- CI job status badges displayed in README  
- Notifications via email or messaging for build failures  
- Periodic review of CI pipelines and test coverage
