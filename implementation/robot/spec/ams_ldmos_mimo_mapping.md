# AMS/LDMOS Sensor Control and MIMO Theory Mapping for AITL-R

## 1. Overview

This document describes the integration of AMS mixed-signal and LDMOS high-voltage device technologies for sensor control within the AITL-R robotic model, aligned with advanced MIMO signal processing theory for robust multi-sensor fusion.

## 2. AMS/LDMOS Hardware Role

- AMS IC provides precise analog signal conditioning, ADC/DAC, power regulation, and isolation needed for sensor interfacing.
- LDMOS IC drives high-voltage actuators with fast switching, high power efficiency, and reliability.
- Combined AMS/LDMOS system enables fine control of sensors and actuators with isolation against noise and interference.

## 3. MIMO Theory Application

- Multi-input multi-output (MIMO) theory applies to simultaneous multi-sensor signal processing, improving signal-to-noise ratio and fault tolerance.
- Spatial and temporal diversity in sensor inputs is exploited to enhance estimation accuracy.
- Control signals from AITL inference layer are mapped to actuator commands via MIMO channel modeling to optimize robot motion.
