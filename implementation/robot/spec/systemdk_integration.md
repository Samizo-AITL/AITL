# SystemDK Integration Specification - AITL-R Model

## 1. Overview

This document defines the interface and integration points between the AITL-R robotic platform and the SystemDK framework for enhanced PoC evaluation, simulation, and educational purposes.

## 2. Integration Objectives

- Seamless data exchange between AITL-R hardware/software and SystemDK environment
- Real-time monitoring and control via SystemDK GUI and APIs
- Support for hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) testing and fault injection
- Facilitate self-repair algorithm validation within SystemDK simulations

## 3. Data Interfaces

| Interface            | Description                                  | Protocol/Format           |
|----------------------|----------------------------------------------|--------------------------|
| Sensor Data Export    | Streaming of raw and fused sensor outputs    | ROS2 topics (DDS) / JSON |
| Control Commands      | Real-time control signals for actuators      | ROS2 services / gRPC     |
| Diagnostic Telemetry  | Health status, error logs, power metrics     | MQTT / REST API          |
| Configuration Data   | Parameter settings and firmware updates       | Secure FTP / OTA         |

## 4. Software Adaptations

- Implementation of SystemDK-compatible ROS2 nodes
- Middleware adapters for telemetry and control data formats
- Extension of self-repair modules to support SystemDK testbench triggers

## 5. Testing and Validation

- End-to-end communication tests between AITL-R and SystemDK
- Simulation scenario synchronization
- Validation of fault injection and recovery workflows

## 6. Future Directions

- Cloud-based dashboard integration for remote monitoring
- Enhanced visualization of MIMO sensor fusion states
- Machine learning model tuning via SystemDK feedback loops
